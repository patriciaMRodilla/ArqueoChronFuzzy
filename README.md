# ArqueoChronFuzzy
Public scripts for replication of the experiments done for metrics in fuzzy archaeological legacy data.


The scripts are written in Python and have no dependencies of any kind. 
They can be run in an online or cloud-based compiler/interpreter, or on your local machine. 
Data inputs are defined as specified in the article in a section at the beginning of each script.

Process:
To replicate the experiments, no modifications are required; simply download each .py file separately and run the Python script. The results of applying the proposed framework's metrics are displayed in detail on the screen.

Each script replicates an experiment detailed in the paper, respectively, Illustration 1, Illustration 2, and Illustration 3.

Each script also includes instructions in its comments for modifying the input data if required by the user.
